Hi, I'm Vignesh!

I see beauty in writing software and in understanding the designs that others have poured their life into. My philosophy on software building can be summed up by these two excerpts alone: [Michelangeloâ€™s Block of Marble](https://jaivigneshvenugopal.github.io/assets/img/statue_of_david.png) and [Joys of the Programming Craft](https://jaivigneshvenugopal.github.io/assets/img/mythical_man_month.png). 

I work to become the best version of the craftsman I can be.
